## What is COMSOL 3.5 and Why Use It?
 
COMSOL 3.5 is a software for multiphysics simulation that allows you to model and simulate real-world designs, devices, and processes in various fields of engineering, science, and mathematics[^1^]. With COMSOL 3.5, you can:

- Create physics-based models that account for multiple physical phenomena and their interactions.
- Solve complex problems using advanced numerical methods and solvers.
- Visualize and analyze your simulation results with interactive graphics and postprocessing tools.
- Build and deploy simulation applications with dedicated user interfaces for your collaborators and customers.

COMSOL 3.5 is a versatile and powerful software that can help you understand, predict, optimize, and innovate your designs and processes. You can choose from a range of add-on modules that provide specialized functionality for different engineering domains, such as electromagnetics, structural mechanics, acoustics, fluid flow, heat transfer, and chemical engineering[^2^]. You can also interface COMSOL 3.5 with CAD and other third-party software using LiveLinkâ¢ products[^2^].
  
## What are the Benefits of COMSOL 3.5?
 
COMSOL 3.5 offers many benefits for engineers, researchers, and scientists who want to simulate real-world phenomena and optimize their designs and processes. Some of the benefits are:

- Accuracy: COMSOL 3.5 enables you to simulate multiple physical effects and their interactions in one environment, following one workflow. This allows you to capture the complexity and realism of your system and obtain accurate and reliable results[^1^] [^2^].
- Versatility: COMSOL 3.5 covers a wide range of engineering domains and applications, such as electromagnetics, structural mechanics, acoustics, fluid flow, heat transfer, and chemical engineering[^2^]. You can also interface COMSOL 3.5 with CAD and other third-party software using LiveLinkâ¢ products[^2^].
- Creativity: COMSOL 3.5 gives you complete control over all aspects of your model and allows you to couple any number of physics phenomena together. You can also input user-defined physics descriptions, with associated equations and expressions, directly in the user interface[^2^].
- Collaboration: COMSOL 3.5 includes the Application Builder, which is used to build specialized apps from models, and the COMSOL Compilerâ¢ and COMSOL Serverâ¢ deployment products for making apps accessible to colleagues and customers who are not experts in simulation software[^1^] [^3^].

COMSOL 3.5 is a powerful and flexible software that can help you achieve your simulation goals and enhance your productivity and innovation.
