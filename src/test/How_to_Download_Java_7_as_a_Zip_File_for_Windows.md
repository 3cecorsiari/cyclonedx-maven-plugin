# How to Download Java 7 as a Zip File for Windows
 
If you want to download Java 7 as a zip file for Windows, you might be wondering why there is no official zip file available from Oracle. The reason is that Oracle only provides exe or msi installers for Java 7, which are designed to set up the Java environment on your system automatically. However, some users might prefer to have more control over the installation process, or simply want to have a portable version of Java 7 that they can copy and run from any folder.

In this article, we will show you how to download Java 7 as a zip file for Windows using a free and open source tool called 7-Zip. 7-Zip is a file archiver that can extract the contents of many types of files, including exe and msi installers. By using 7-Zip, you can extract the Java files from the official installer and create your own zip file that you can use as you wish.
 
## Step 1: Download Java 7 Installer
 
The first step is to download the Java 7 installer from Oracle's website. You can choose between the Java SE Development Kit (JDK) or the Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE), depending on your needs. The JDK includes tools for developing and testing Java applications, while the JRE only includes the components needed to run them. You can also choose between the 32-bit or 64-bit versions, depending on your system architecture.
 
You can find the Java 7 archive downloads here[^1^]. For example, if you want to download the JDK 7u80 for Windows x64, you can click on the link jdk-7u80-windows-x64.exe and save it to your desired location.
 
## Step 2: Download and Install 7-Zip
 
The next step is to download and install 7-Zip on your system. 7-Zip is a free and open source file archiver that can handle many types of compressed files, including zip, rar, tar, gz, bz2, iso, dmg, and more. It also has a powerful command line interface that allows you to perform various operations on files.
 
You can download 7-Zip from here[^3^]. You can choose between the stable version (16.04) or the beta version (21.02 alpha). You can also choose between the 32-bit or 64-bit versions, depending on your system architecture. For example, if you want to download the stable version of 7-Zip for Windows x64, you can click on the link 7z1604-x64.exe and save it to your desired location.
 
After downloading 7-Zip, you can run the installer and follow the instructions to install it on your system. You can also use the portable version of 7-Zip if you don't have administrator privileges or don't want to install anything on your system.
 
## Step 3: Extract Java Files from Installer
 
The final step is to extract the Java files from the installer using 7-Zip. To do this, you need to open a command prompt window and navigate to the folder where you saved the Java installer. For example, if you saved it in C:\\Downloads, you can type:

    cd C:\\Downloads

Then, you need to use 7-Zip to extract all the files from the installer into a new folder. For example, if you want to extract them into a folder called C:\\JDK, you can type:

    7z x jdk-7u80-windows-x64.exe -oC:\\JDK

This will create a folder called C:\\JDK with all the extracted files inside. You can also use any other name or location for your destination folder.
 
If you want to extract only specific files from the installer, you can use filters with 7-Zip. For example, if you only want to extract the bin folder with all the executable files, you can type:

    7z x jdk-7u80-windows-x64.exe -oC:\\JDK bin\\*
